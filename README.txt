To test:
Go to chrome, extensions, turn on developer mode, load unpacked extension, choose this folder. Click update after making code changes

When adding / changing elements refer to bootstrap 5 documentation

What needs to be done:
 - Trying to get keyword forms into 2 rows, would just look better
 - Add submit button to form, write JS script to get text on submit, take values and put into list,
 - Write script to get numbers/symbols on click, take values and put into list. (Not overly concerned with enforcing 5 values clicked on right now)
 - once we have all these variables... keep word and symbols/numbers list separate so that we can choose a couple random from each one, then append list together and select random through all values to get final output
